This tool is written in Ruby which uses a library to transpile Ruby script into JavaScript. To give you a better idea of what this CLI application does, it can track files with the extension '.*.rb' in real time and transpile them to another file with native JS script (note that the extension has a star and this indicates the type of file we want to save the transpiled script to).

This is a newer version that has changed the architecture of the code and it is possible to implement custom plugins to extend the functionality of RubyJS-Vite. Therefore, you need to take care that since version 2.0.0 everything is different and if you are using an older version. So I recommend to look at another [branch marked with version 1.1](https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js/tree/1.1), or upgrade to a newer version.
