# RubyJS-Vite

This is a newer version of RubyJS-Vite tool. This is the 2.0.0 version, which will use its own ecosystem for plugins (plugins will be independent).

The readme is not broken yet and I recommend to go to the [1.1 branch](https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js/tree/1.1) where you can find the older version of RubyJS-Vite tool with help or example projects.

> ### Warning
> The new version is not yet in production on Ruby Gem.
